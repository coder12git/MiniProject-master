# Packaging Material Sustainability Calculator

A web based calculator to access the environment impact of different packaging materials. The calculator displays the sustainability matrix of different packaging materials.

 In the context of the Environmental Impact Score, a higher score generally indicates that a material is considered more environmentally friendly. This implies that the material has a lower overall impact on the environment when considering various sustainability metrics such as carbon footprint, recyclability, biodegradability, energy consumption, water usage, and waste generation.

**Output based on Sustainability** :
- High: Environmental Impact Score above 7.5 (High Environment Friendly)
- Medium: Environmental Impact Score between 5.0 and 7.5
- Low: Environmental Impact Score below 5.0 (Low Environment Friendly)
